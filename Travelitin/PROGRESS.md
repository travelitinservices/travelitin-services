  - `forgot_password_page.dart`: Added password reset functionality
- Removed duplicate Firebase initialization code
- Standardized error handling across all auth pages

### 2. Map Functionality
- Created centralized `MapService` class to handle all map-related operations:
  - Location services
  - Geocoding
  - Place search
  - Distance calculations
- Updated map-related pages:
  - `map_view_page.dart`: Implemented current location display
  - `search_place_page.dart`: Added place search functionality
- Improved error handling for location services
- Added proper permission handling for location access

### 3. Feedback System
- Created centralized `FeedbackService` class to handle all feedback operations:
  - Feedback submission
  - Feedback retrieval
  - Feedback updates
  - Feedback deletion
- Updated feedback pages:
  - `allfeedback.dart`: Implemented feedback list view with real-time updates
  - `displayfeed.dart`: Added feedback submission form with rating system
- Added proper error handling for Firestore operations
- Implemented real-time updates using Firestore streams

### 4. API and Services
- Created centralized `ApiService` class for HTTP operations:
  - GET, POST, PUT, DELETE methods
  - Response handling
  - Error management
- Standardized API response handling across the application
- Improved error handling for network requests

## Code Quality Improvements

- Added proper error messages for user feedback
- Improved error recovery mechanisms

### 2. State Management
- Implemented proper state management in all pages
- Added loading states for async operations
- Improved UI feedback during operations

### 3. Code Reusability
- Created shared services for common functionality
- Removed duplicate code across features
- Standardized common operations

### 4. UI/UX Improvements
- Added loading indicators for async operations
- Implemented proper form validation
- Added user feedback for all operations
- Improved navigation between pages

## Known Issues

1. Need to implement proper error boundaries
2. Add retry mechanisms for failed network requests
3. Implement proper data caching
4. Add offline support

## Dependencies Added/Updated

- `google_maps_flutter`: For map functionality
- `geolocator`: For location services
- `geocoding`: For address/coordinate conversion
- `cloud_firestore`: For database operations
- `go_router`: For navigation
- `jwt_decoder`: For JWT token handling
- `shared_preferences`: For secure token storage
- `crypto`: For JWT signing

## Security Improvements

1. Centralized authentication handling
2. Proper permission management
3. Secure API calls
4. Protected routes
5. JWT Authentication Implementation:
   - Token generation on login/signup
   - Token verification for API requests
