The Core layer contains shared resources and utilities that are used across the application. It includes configurations, constants, utilities, themes, and reusable widgets that are not specific to any single feature.

Key Components:
- Constants: Static values used throughout the application, such as API endpoints or configuration settings.
- Utils: Utility classes and functions that provide common functionality, such as date formatting or validation.
- Themes: Classes that define the application's visual appearance, including colors and typography.
- Widgets: Reusable UI components that can be shared across different parts of the application.

Responsibilities:
- Provide shared resources and utilities to other layers.
- Define the application's global configurations and settings.
- Ensure consistency in the application's appearance and behavior.
- Promote code reuse and reduce duplication across the application.
