The Presentation layer is responsible for the user interface (UI) and user interaction logic. It contains widgets, screens, and state management components that display data to the user and handle user inputs.

Key Components:
- Widgets: Reusable UI components that define the structure and appearance of the app's interface.
- Screens: Full-page views that represent different sections or pages of the app.
- State Management: Manages the state of the UI components, ensuring that the UI reflects the current state of the application.

Responsibilities:
- Display data received from the Application layer.
- Handle user inputs and interactions.
- Notify the Application layer of user actions.
- Maintain the UI's state and manage navigation.
