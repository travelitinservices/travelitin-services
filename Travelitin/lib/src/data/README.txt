The Data layer is responsible for data retrieval and storage operations. It interacts with external data sources, such as APIs or databases, and provides data to the Domain layer.

Key Components:
- Models: Classes that represent data structures used for data transfer between layers.
- Repositories: Classes that implement the data access operations defined in the Domain layer's repository interfaces.
- Data Sources: Components that handle the interaction with external data sources, such as APIs or local databases.

Responsibilities:
- Fetch data from external sources and transform it into models.
- Implement the data access operations defined in the Domain layer's repository interfaces.
- Provide data to the Domain layer for business logic processing.
- Handle data persistence and retrieval operations.
